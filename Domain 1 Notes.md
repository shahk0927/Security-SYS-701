## Domain 1.0: General Security Concepts

### 1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls

#### Security Control Categories
*   **Technical:** Controls that use technology. For example, a firewall or encryption.
*   **Managerial:** Policies and rules created by management. For example, user access policies and security training.
*   **Operational:** The daily processes that enforce security. For example, log monitoring and vulnerability scanning.
*   **Physical:** Tangible controls you can touch. For example, locks, fences, and security guards.

#### Security Control Types
*   **Preventive:** Acts to stop a security event from happening.
*   **Deterrent:** Discourages a potential attacker from even trying.
*   **Detective:** Identifies a security event that is already in progress or has occurred.
*   **Corrective:** Fixes damage and restores a system after an incident.
*   **Compensating:** A substitute control when the primary one is not feasible.
*   **Directive:** A policy or guideline that dictates security behavior.

### 1.2 Summarize Fundamental Security Concepts

*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA):** The core principles of information security. Confidentiality ensures data is private, Integrity ensures it has not been altered, and Availability ensures it is accessible when needed.
*   **Non-repudiation:** The assurance that a party cannot deny an action. This is often achieved with digital signatures.
*   **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA):**
    *   **Authentication:** Verifies a user's identity.
    *   **Authorization:** Grants access to resources based on identity.
    *   **Accounting:** Tracks and logs user actions for auditing.
*   **Gap Analysis:** The process of comparing a current state to a desired future state to identify what is missing.
*   **Zero Trust:** A security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Every user and device must be authenticated and authorized before gaining access. It operates on a control plane (managing access) and a data plane (the network where data resides).
*   **Physical Security:** Tangible measures to protect assets. This includes bollards to stop vehicles, access control vestibules (mantraps) to control entry, fences, video surveillance, security guards, access badges, and adequate lighting.
*   **Deception and Disruption Technology:** Intentionally misleading attackers. A honeypot is a decoy system, a honeynet is a network of decoys, a honeyfile is a decoy file, and a honeytoken is a piece of data designed to be attractive to an attacker.

### 1.3 Explain the Importance of Change Management Processes
Change management is a formal process for managing all changes to an IT environment to minimize security risks.

#### Business Processes
*   **Approval Process:** All changes must be formally approved by stakeholders and an owner.
*   **Impact Analysis:** The potential effect of the change on security and business operations is assessed.
*   **Test Results:** Changes are tested in a non-production environment before deployment.
*   **Backout Plan:** A plan to reverse the change if it causes issues.
*   **Maintenance Window:** A specific time frame for making the change to minimize disruption.
*   **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):** A written guide to ensure consistent and secure execution of the change.

#### Technical Implications
*   **Allow/Deny Lists:** Changes to these lists can inadvertently block legitimate traffic or allow malicious traffic.
*   **Downtime/Restarts:** Changes to systems or applications often require planned downtime or service restarts, which can disrupt business operations.
*   **Legacy Applications:** Older applications may be fragile and have unexpected issues with changes.
*   **Dependencies:** Changes to one system can break others that depend on it.

#### Documentation
*   **Updating Diagrams:** Network and system diagrams must be kept current to reflect changes.
*   **Updating Policies/Procedures:** Security policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) must be revised to include the new changes.
*   **Version Control:** Using a version control system ensures that all changes to code or configurations are tracked, allowing for easy rollback if needed.

### 1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

*   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** A system for creating, managing, and revoking digital certificates.
*   **Public Key:** A key that can be shared openly to encrypt data or verify a digital signature.
*   **Private Key:** A secret key that is kept confidential to decrypt data or create a digital signature.
*   **Key Escrow:** A process where a copy of a private key is securely stored by a third party.
*   **Encryption:** The process of converting data into an unreadable format.

#### Types of Encryption
*   **Asymmetric:** Uses a public/private key pair. Slower but allows for secure key exchange.
*   **Symmetric:** Uses a single shared secret key. Faster but requires a secure way to share the key.
*   **Key Exchange:** The process of securely sharing cryptographic keys.
*   **Algorithms:** The mathematical rules used for encryption (e.g., AES, RSA).

#### Tools
*   **Trusted Platform Module (TPM):** A chip on a motherboard that stores cryptographic keys and provides a hardware-based root of trust.
*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** A physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys.
*   **Secure Enclave:** A secure, isolated area on a processor that protects data from the rest of the system.

#### Techniques
*   **Obfuscation:** Techniques to intentionally make data difficult to understand or analyze.
*   **Steganography:** Hiding data within another file (e.g., an image or audio file).
*   **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive data with a unique, non-sensitive identifier.
*   **Data Masking:** Hiding or replacing sensitive data with realistic-looking, but false, data.
*   **Hashing:** A one-way function that creates a unique, fixed-length value (hash) from data. It's used for integrity checking, as any change to the data will result in a different hash.
*   **Salting:** Random data added to a password before it is hashed. This protects against rainbow table attacks.
*   **Digital Signatures:** A cryptographic method used for non-repudiation and integrity. It proves the authenticity of a message or document and that it has not been altered.
*   **Key Stretching:** Techniques used to make a weak password more difficult to crack by increasing the computational effort required to test each guess.

#### Advanced Concepts
*   **Blockchain/Open Public Ledger:** A decentralized, distributed ledger that stores an immutable record of transactions. Used for security and transparency.
*   **Certificates:** Electronic documents used to verify a user or server's identity.
*   **Certificate Authorities (CAs):** Trusted organizations that issue digital certificates.
*   **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs):** A list of certificates that have been revoked and should no longer be trusted.
*   **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** A protocol for real-time validation of certificate status.
*   **Root of Trust:** A public key trusted implicitly by a system. All certificates in a chain must link back to a trusted root.
*   **Certificate Signing Request (CSR):** A file generated by a server and sent to a CA to request a digital certificate.
*   **Wildcard:** A certificate that secures multiple subdomains under a single domain.
